-- All My Reservations

-- When a user is logged in, they will have an option to view all of their reservations. This page will show details about a reservation and details about the property associated with the reservation.

-- Show all reservations for a user.

-- Select all columns from the reservations table, all columns from the properties table, and the average rating of the property.
-- The reservations will be for a single user, so use 1 for the user_id.
-- Order the results from the earliest start_date to the most recent start_date.
-- These will end up being filtered by either "Upcoming Reservations" or "Past Reservations", so only get reservations where the end_date is in the past.
-- Use now()::date to get today's date.
-- Limit the results to 10.
